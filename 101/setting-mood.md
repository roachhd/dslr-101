### Setting the mood

The next step is to determine if you will be shooting a subject in motion, and, if so, how you want it to look. Your answer will help you set your shutter speed, which determines the length of time the shutter remains open. Leaving your shutter open a long time will let in lots of light and will capture motion as it moves â€“ meaning you will see it as a blur. A short shutter speed, like a quick blink, freezes a moment in time without blur.
