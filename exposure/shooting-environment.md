### Your shooting environment

In photography, ambient light refers to any source of light in the scene that is not supplied by the photographer. Ambient light could be light from side table lamps, candles on a birthday cake or the lights on Christmas tree. Many photographers enjoy shooting with only ambient light because it helps preserve the atmosphere of the scene.

Since ambient lighting can be unpredictable, you need to be aware of your exposure settings for each and every photograph. In bright sunlight, your settings will need to be adjusted to decrease the amount of light your camera is capturing. When there is less light available (like when someone blowing out the candles on a birthday cake) you will need to adjust your settings to capture more light.
