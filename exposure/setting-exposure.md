### Setting the Exposure

To get a good exposure in manual mode you will need to balance between the aperture and shutter speed. A large aperture will let in lots of light, to balance this your shutter speed will need to be set for a shorter/faster time. When your aperture is smaller, there is less light coming into your camera so you can use a longer/slower shutter speed to compensate.
