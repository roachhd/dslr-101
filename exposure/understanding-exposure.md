### Understanding Exposure

Understanding the three elements that affect exposure (ISO, Shutter Speed and Aperture) and learning how to control them, will help you achieve the results you want in your final image. The first step is to determine the environment you’ll be shooting in. This will help you determine your ISO. The ISO controls the sensitivity of the image sensor in your camera. A high ISO setting means that the image sensor is operating at full capability and capturing more, so you don’t need as much light when you shoot at a high ISO. A high ISO will allow you to shoot in low light situations – like indoors at a dinner. With a low ISO – your sensor is not running at full capacity, which means that you have more flexibility in the amount of light you can let into your camera. A low ISO setting is perfect for a bright sunny day.
